            <h2 className="mt-2">My Goals</h2>
            I realized that I love designing, the amount of thought that goes
            into creating everyday products for people is insane yet also when the job
            is well done, is also barely visible. 
            Also really love computer systems, the complexity is incredible and soemtimes
            I wonder how people made it, and then I hope that I become one of those people
            that can truly understand computers
            But full stack is amazingly fun, how a website runs, how backend and frontend
            connect together is an incredible procedure.
